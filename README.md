### infrared
Dauto.f90 is a basic Fotran-90 code for calculating an infrared spectra, applying a quantum correction factor, and smoothing it. 

input options in Dauto.inp

format of the dipole moment input file : x, y z of each dipole in 3 columns -- this can be the dipole moments of all molecules or total dipole moment of box, at each timestep

A new, more modular and cleaned up version of this code is under developement in /new_version

code for velocity-velocity autocorrelation function and density of states is in /DOS
